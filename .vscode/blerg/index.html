    <p>Well, suppose maybe you run into situations where in a comment or something it says: this code does X. then someone uses
       the code to feed starving orphans and then someone sues you for killing starving orphans because your code didn't work
       right. Even if they wouldn't win, maybe this is enough to not just automatically get summary judgement in your (the
       original author) favor causing massive legal expenses or settlement. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A LAWYER, JUST A
       DRUNK DUDE WHO WRITES STUFF AND PUTS IT ON THE INTERNET. do ur own research, lol C:&lt;</p>
